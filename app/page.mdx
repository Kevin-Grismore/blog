# Kevin Grismore

Hi! I'm Kevin. I've been a data engineer,
a product advocate, a sales engineer, a solutions engineer, and
most recently, a technical product manager.

I've found that my most successful and exciting work happens when I help inform how non-technical users
interact with the outcomes of complex engineering systems.

For examples of my work, check out my <u><Link href="/blog">blog</Link></u>.

I'd like to work with people committed to improving material conditions for average people, and I believe that technology is most
worthwhile when it is wielded through value systems that put people first.
