# Kevin Grismore

Hi!
I'm Kevin. I've been a data engineer, a product advocate, a sales engineer, a solutions engineer, and most recently, a technical product manager.

I've found that my most successful and exciting work happens when I help inform how non-technical users interact with the outcomes of complex engineering systems.
I believe that technology is most worthwhile when it is wielded through value systems that put people first.

For examples of my work, check out the links in my <u><Link href="/about">resume</Link></u>.
Keep scrolling for pictures of my cat, Linda.
